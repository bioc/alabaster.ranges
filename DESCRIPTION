Description: 
    Save GenomicRanges, IRanges and related data structures into file artifacts, and load them back into memory.
    This is a more portable alternative to serialization of such objects into RDS files.
    Each artifact is associated with metadata for further interpretation;
    downstream applications can enrich this metadata with context-specific properties.
